<!--It's not clear to me how to make the PicBoxes appear two by two - when I narrow the width of container1 to, say, 660px, the 
    page looks like the one shown in the instructions. But the instructions were pretty clear that the content width on the site was 960px. Further, 
    if I change the width of the container, I'd have to change the width of the header so that it lines up. That would give me separate dimensions 
    for each page; which would leave me with a one-size-fits-one solution rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Is there something that I am 
    missing?

                    <p>I spent nearly three decades inside and outside of law firms around the world, in a
                        broad range of marketing, communications, and business development roles. Now it's time
                        for a change. I'm switching my sights to a new language: that of coding web applications,
                        and I hope one day to be as fluent in css, html, javascript, and other languages as I am in
                        French and law marketing...</p>
                    <p>I've been fooling around with computers since I was in high school without taking it
                        seriously. In the late 70s I had a Commodore VIC-20 on which I'd program dice games that I
                        would save to a cassette tape. In college I made some money translating Apple programs into
                        MS Basic. I started 'surfing the web' in the mid 90s via dial-up bulletin boards and
                        CompuServe before moving to Netscape Navigator. </p>
                    <p>I’ve lived in the United States, France, and Hong Kong. Currently I'm in Cleveland Heights,
                        Ohio, with my wife and two children. I'm active in the CHUH schoool district community,
                        where I'm president of the Roxboro Middle School PTA, cofounder of the <a href="http://www.ensembletheatrecle.org/heightsperformingartscamp/"
                            target="blank">Heights Performing Arts Camp</a>, and on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://www.reachingheights.org"
                            target="blank">Reaching Heights</a>, a community
                        organization dedicated to providing support to our local public schools and students. When
                        I’m not out on my bike or in the yoga studio, you’ll probably find me reading.</p>
