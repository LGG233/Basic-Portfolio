            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img id="bio-pic" src="assets/images/Me.jpg" alt="Lance Godard">
            <p>I spent nearly three decades inside and outside of law firms around the world, providing a broad range of marketing, communications, and business development solutions. Now it's time for a change. I'm switching my sights to a new language: that of coding web applications, and  I hope one day to be as fluent in css, html, javascript, and other languages as I am in law marketing and French...</p>
            <p>I've been fooling around with computers since I was in high school without taking it seriously. In the late 70s I had a Commodore VIC-20 that I'd program to place dice games which I would save to a cassette tape. In college I made some money translating Apple programs into MS Basic. I started 'surfing the web' in the mid 90s via dial-up bulletin boards and CompuServe before moving to Netscape Navigator. </p> 
            <p>I’ve lived and worked in the United States, France, and Hong Kong, and currently live in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, with my wife and two children. I'm active in the CHUH schoool district community, where I'm president of the Roxboro Middle School PTA, cofounder of the <a href="http://www.ensembletheatrecle.org/heightsperformingartscamp/" target="blank">Heights Performing Arts Camp</a>, and on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://www.reachingheights.org" target="blank">Reaching Heights</a>, a community organization dedicated to providing support to our local public schools and students. When I’m not out on my bike or in the yoga studio, you’ll probably find me reading.</p>
